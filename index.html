    <h1>My Experience at AkiraChix</h1>
  <P>My experience at AkiraChix has been good so far except for few ups.
    I love the place because i has people from different diversities.
    The students are so friendly so every individual is interested in interacting and making friends.
    <ol><h2>Good experience at AkiraChix</h2>
      <li>The beautiful rooms</li>
      <li>The Kaya</li>
      <li>The well structured classes</li>
      <li>The friendly Alumni</li>
      <li>The food</li>
    </ol><h3>Bad experience at AkiraChix</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Shortage of water</li>
      <li>Confusing on the first day</li>
      <li>Adapting to new environment</li>
      <li>Few hanging lines</li>
      <h4>The courses</h4>
      <p>According to my expectations since the first day i found this opportunity,
        I knew i was going to study one course but the day i arrived her i found at different courses.
        The courses are related and confusing therefore i will somedays move from this cluttering to clearity.
        I some enjoyeable but some needs time to catch up.
      </p>
      <h5>The diversity</h5>
      <p>This is one of the values of AkiraChix which makes people relate easily with others.
        It makes people feel welcomed and feel at home as you see many others from your communities around.
        The friendly and welcoming Kenyans community who live without discriminations are the best around.
      </p>
      <h6>Collaboration</h6>
      <p>since the first day i arrived at AkiraChix,we have been able to work have embrace a lot of teamwork.
        I came to this school knowing a few things about the school but meeting some good hearted,
        people i manage to reach this week of month still coping.We work as a team in our school and in our classes.
        So far the learning is interesting therefore, i am willing to cope with life.
      </p>
